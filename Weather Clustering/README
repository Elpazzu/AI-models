This is a K-means clustering analysis to generate a big picture model of the weather at a local station using a minute-graunlarity data. 

K-means clustering tries to minimize distances within a cluster and maximize the distance between different clusters. A K-means algorithm is not capable of determining the 
number of clusters, so we need to define it when creating the KMeans object (it may be a challenging task)

K-Means is an iterative process:
1. Randomly select centroids (center of cluster) for each cluster
2. Calculate the distance of all data points to the centroids
3. Assign data points to the closest cluster
4. Find the new centroids of each cluster by taking the mean of all data points in the cluster
5. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 until all points converge and cluster centers stop moving

The minute weather dataset used here contains ~1.5 million raw sensor measurements captured at one-minute intervals. The data comes from a weather station located in San Diego, 
California. That station is equipped with sensors that capture weather-related measurements such as air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 

Data was collected for a period of three years, from September 2011 to September 2014, to ensure that sufficient data for different seasons and weather conditions is captured. 
Each row in the dataset contains weather data captured for a one-minute interval:
- rowID = unique number for each row (Unit: NA)
- hpwren_timestamp = timestamp of measure (Unit: year-month-day hour:minute:second)
- air_pressure = air pressure measured at the timestamp (Unit: hectopascals)
- air_temp = air temperature measure at the timestamp (Unit: degrees Fahrenheit)
- avg_wind_direction = wind direction averaged over the minute before the timestamp (Unit: degrees, with 0 means coming from the North, and increasing clockwise)
- avg_wind_speed = wind speed averaged over the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters per second)
- max_wind_direction = highest wind direction in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: degrees, with 0 being North and increasing clockwise)
- max_wind_speed = highest wind speed in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters per second)
- min_wind_direction = smallest wind direction in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: degrees, with 0 being North and inceasing clockwise)
- min_wind_speed = smallest wind speed in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters per second)
- rain_accumulation = amount of accumulated rain measured at the timestamp (Unit: millimeters)
- rain_duration = length of time rain has fallen as measured at the timestamp (Unit: seconds)
- relative_humidity = relative humidity measured at the timestamp (Unit: percent)
