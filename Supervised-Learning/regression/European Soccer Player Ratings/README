This exercise was made in response to the following Kaggle post: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer 

Soccer database used for the exercise contains:
* +25,000 matches
* +10,000 players
* 11 European Countries with their lead championship
* Seasons 2008 to 2016
* Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates
* Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)
* Betting odds from up to 10 providers
* Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etc.) for +10,000 matches

The purpose of the models built was to predict the overall ratings of soccer players. We use regression techniques as ratings are continuous variables.

Results of the implementations:
Linear Regression: RMSE = ~2.82
Decision Trees Regression: RMSE = ~1.45

As the RMSE is the square root of the variance of the residuals, lower values of RMSE indicate better fit. 
That means that the DTRegressor performed better in this case.
