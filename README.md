# AI-models

In this repo, I store the source codes of AI models that I develop on my personal Anaconda instance. 

Most of the algirhtms in this repo are explained in detail on my personal website >>> https://www.data-analysis-makb.com/

If you have any question, remark or suggestion, don't hesitate to contact me!
